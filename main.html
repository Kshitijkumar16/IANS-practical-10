               <p class="aim"><b>Aim:<br>To implement Vernam Cipher and understand Perfect Secrecy.</b></p>
               <p class="tex1"><li>Vernam cipher is, in theory, a perfect cipher.</li> 
                    <br>
                    <li>Instead of a single key, each plain text character is encrypted using
                    its own key.</li> 
                    <br>
                    <li>This means that there is no way that the cipher text can be deciphered without the key.</li>
               </p>
               <p class="tex2">Here we see a perfectly secure cryptosystem which was developed by Gilbert
                    Vernam in 1918.
                    
                    <br><br> Vernam sees a trade off between security and convenience, and the trade-off has to do with the
                    length of the key tape as its security depends on the fact that the key is used only once. </br>

               </br>
               <p class="tex3">The main idea is to realize that any perfectly secure encryption scheme (and
                    not just the One-Time Pad) requires the keyspace to be at least as large as the message space, and
                    is therefore impractical</p>
